When Tower is configured with `REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS = ['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', 'REMOTE_ADDR', 'REMOTE_HOST']`, it assumes that the value of `X-Forwarded-For` has originated from the proxy/load balancer sitting in front of Tower. In a scenario where Tower is still reachable without use of the proxy/load balancer or when the proxy does not validate the header, `X-Forwarded-For` can be spoofed fairly easily to fake the originating IP addresses. Using `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` in the `REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS` setting poses a vulnerability that essentially gives users access to certain resources that they should not have.

.Example vulnerabilities:

* The host config key for a job template
* The hostname or ansible_(ssh_)host of a host in the job template's linked inventory
* The url of the job template's provisioning callback
