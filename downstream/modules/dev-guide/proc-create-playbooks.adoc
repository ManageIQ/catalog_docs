= Creating playbooks

[role="_abstract"]
Playbooks start with the three YAML dashes (---) followed by:

* Name: a brief description of the overall function of the playbook, which assists in keeping it readable and organized for all users.
* Hosts: identifies the target(s) for Ansible to run against.
* Become statements: this optional statement can be set to `true`/`yes` to activate privilege escalation (e.g., sudo, su, pfexec, doas, pbrun, dzdo, ksu, etc.).
* Tasks: this is where actions that get executed via a call to an Ansible module get listed.
