= Creating roles

[role="_abstract"]
Using the `ansible-galaxy` command line tool that comes bundled with Ansible, you can create a role with the `init` command.

As an example, the following command will create a role directory structure called `role_name` in the current working directory:

-----
$ ansible-galaxy init role_name
-----

 The `role_name` directory will contain the following:

-----
.travis.yml
README.md
defaults/
    main.yml
files/
handlers/
    main.yml
meta/
    main.yml
tasks/
    main.yml
templates/
tests/
    inventory
    test.yml
vars/
    main.yml
