= Build args and base image

The `build_arg_defaults` section of the definition file is a dictionary whose keys can provide default values for arguments to {Builder}. See the following table for a list of values that can be used in `default_build_args`:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_CLI_COLLECTION_OPTS`
| * Allows the user to pass the `â€“pre` flag to enable the installation of pre-releases collections
* `-c` is the equivalent of setting `verify_ssl` to `false`

| `EE_BASE_IMAGE`
| Specifies the parent image for the {ExecEnvNameSing}, enabling a new image to be built that is based off of an already-existing image

| `EE_BUILDER_IMAGE`
| Specifies the image used for compiling-type tasks
|===

The values given inside `build_arg_defaults` will be hard-coded into the `Containerfile`, so these values will persist if `podman build` is called manually.

NOTE: If the same variable is specified in the CLI `--build-arg` flag, the CLI value will take higher precedence.
