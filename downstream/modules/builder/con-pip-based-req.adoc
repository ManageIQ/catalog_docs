= Note for `pip`-based requirements

Python requirements files are combined into a single file using the `requirements-parser` library in order to support complex syntax. Entries from separate collections that give the same package name will be combined into the same entry, with the constraints combined.

There are several package names which are specifically ignored by `ansible-builder`; if a collection lists these, they will not be included in the combined file. These include test packages and packages that provide Ansible itself.

The full list can be found in `EXCLUDE_REQUIREMENTS` in the https://github.com/ansible/ansible-builder/blob/devel/ansible_builder/requirements.py[ansible_builder.requirements.py] module.
