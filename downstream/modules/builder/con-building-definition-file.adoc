= Building a definition file

Once you have {Builder} installed, we will need to create a definition file which {Builder} will use to create your {ExecEnvNameSing} image. The high level process to build an {ExecEnvNameSing} image is for {Builder} to read and validate your definition file, then create a `Containerfile`, and finally pass the `Containerfile` to Podman which then packages and creates your {ExecEnvNameSing} image. The definition file we will create for {Builder} is in `yaml` format and contains different sections which we will discuss in further detail.

The following is an example of a definition file:
