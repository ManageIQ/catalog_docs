= Installing {ControllerName} with a database on the same node

:context: assembly-single-node

[role="_abstract"]
You can use these instructions to install a standalone instance of {ControllerName} with a database on the same node, or a non-installer managed database. This scenario includes installation of {ControllerName}, including the web frontend, REST API backend, and database on a single machine. It installs PostgreSQL, and configures the {ControllerName} to use that as its database. This is considered the standard {ControllerName} installation scenario.
