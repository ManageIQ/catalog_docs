= Populating your private {HubName} container registry


:context: populate-container-registry


[role="_abstract"]
By default, private {HubName} does not include container images. To populate your container registry, you need to push a container image to it. The procedures in this section describe how to pull images from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog (registry.redhat.io), tag them, and push them to your private {HubName} container registry.

== Prerequisites

* You have permissions to create new containers and push containers to private {HubName}.
